## üé® UI / UX Design Features

- **Glassmorphism Style:**  
  Transparent backgrounds with subtle blurs to give a modern, frosted glass look.

  Multi-layer gradients that smoothly blend colors for depth and atmosphere.

- **Hover Effects:**  
  Buttons, links, and cards change color, glow, or slightly move when hovered over, adding interactivity.

  When clicking on a menu item, the page scrolls smoothly to that section instead of jumping instantly.

  Elements fade or slide into view as the user scrolls down, powered by the Intersection Observer API.
